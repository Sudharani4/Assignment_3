Based on my analysis, I concluded that the factors that most likely lead to a particular user adopting the product are when the user is invited to join another user's workspace or is invited to an organization as a guest. My analysis also demonstrates that being a member of certain organizations, makes it more likely for a user to adopt the product. The tuned classifier also found three of the email domains to be of increased importance (and if the user signed up using google authentication), as well as being invited to become a full member of an organization.

Based on the above, I would make the following recommendations to Relax regarding their attempts to improve future user adoption:
Run promotions seeking to incentivize users to invite prospective users to join their personal workspaces on the product;
Run promotions seeking to incentivize organizations to grow by sending guest and/or full invites to prospective users to join the product;
Promote certain organizations identified by the model above (in particular org_id_0) to all users; and
Target its regular email marketing drip to existing and prospective users with yahoo.com, hotmail.com, and gmail.com email addresses.
